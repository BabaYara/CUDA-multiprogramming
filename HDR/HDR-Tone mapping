Overview of operation to be performed:

Find the minimum and maximum value of Luminance- Min and Max Reduce operation
Subtract to find the range
Generate a histogram of all the values in the Luminance channel using the formula:
	 bin = (lum[i] - lumMin) / lumRange * numBins - Histogram operation
Exclusive scan (prefix sum) on the histogram to get the cumulative distribution of
luminance values
