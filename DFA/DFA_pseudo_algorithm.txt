Assumptions:
1. States are numbered from 0 to ... and 0 is the starting state.
2. Input alphabet contains small letter alphabets a to z.
3. Transition function must be complete.

Pseudo-code DFA
Step 1: Create transition matrix from given transition function
Step 2: Dump the transition matrix and input string in global memory
Step 3: Each block copies transition matrix in its shared memory
Step 4: Threads take its part of input for computation in local memory
Step 5: Threads create a vector of possible outputs with all states
Step 6: Reduce the results at block level in binary fashion
Step 7: Reduce the reduced result at grid level in binary fashion
Step 8: Copy back the final result to host
